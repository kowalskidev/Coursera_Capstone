    "- Categories: Category of Hotel. e.g.: *Hotel, Resort*\n",

    "- lat: Latitude. e.g.: *40.753467*\n",
    "- lng: Longitude. e.g.: *-73.993898*\n",

    "Now, Combine both Dataframe Resulting into New Final Dataframe Consisting Data of Hotel + Nearby Places with Co-ordinates  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally We will Generate Map of all Nearby Places along with the 5 Hotels and make 5 clusters of Hotels + Nearby Places using **K-Means Algorithm**\n",
